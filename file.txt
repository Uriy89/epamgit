So close, no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart

And nothing else matters

Never opened myself this way
Life is ours, we live it our way


Trust I seek and I find in you
Every day for us something new
Open mind for a different view
And nothing else matters

Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know

But I know

So close, no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
And nothing else matters

Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
